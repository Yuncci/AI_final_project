# AI_final_project
This is the final project for 2023 spring Artificial Intelligence course in NYCU

## Task Overview
We compared the performance of the CLIP model and ResNet on image recognition tasks, and conducted tests using datasets such as ImageNet and AWA2. Finally, we utilized the CLIP model to achieve image search functionality.
