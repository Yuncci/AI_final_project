# AI_final_project
This is the final project for 2023 spring Artificial Intelligence course in NYCU



## Task Overview
We compared the performance of the CLIP model and ResNet on image recognition tasks, and conducted tests using datasets such as ImageNet and AWA2. Finally, we utilized the CLIP model to achieve image search functionality.



## Prerequisite


### Coding environment
We utilized the __Google Colab__ web platform for the development of our final project. You can install all the necessary dependencies simply by executing the installation commands within Colab.


### Packages version
If you still need information about the required packages, please refer to the requirements.txt file or use the following command.
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


### Usage
You can execute the code located in Google Colab by clicking on the link in the __Final_project.ipynb file__. Execute all cells in Colab that start with "Step", and then choose to execute either the image recognition part or the text-based/image-based image search part based on your needs.
